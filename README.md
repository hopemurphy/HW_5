Problem 1
  Use munich_temperatures_average_with_bad_data.txt and fit a curve to it. 
  Two curves are shown in the graph (first guess and the actually fit that pythong predicts. 
  
  
  Two graphs are uploaded. Figure) for frequency=5.0 becuase the graph looks like a better fit
                           Figure2) for frequency=1.0 becuase it is a more reasonable guess
  
  Fitting_Weather2 is for 2008-2012 like it is asked for in the probblem, while Fitting_Weather is for all munich temperatures.
                           There is a figure- Figure1_prob1.png
